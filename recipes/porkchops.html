        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 pork chops</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoning salt</li>
            <li>2 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white wine</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder 
                and seasoning salt. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. 
                Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, 
                and coat liberally with bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Fry the pork chops until the breading appears well browned, 
                about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a 9x13-inch 
                baking dish, and cover with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. While baking, 
                combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and white 
                wine in a medium bowl. Cover the pork chops with the 
                soup mixture. Replace foil, and continue to bake for 
                another 30 minutes.</li>
